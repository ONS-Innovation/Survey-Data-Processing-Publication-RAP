## 

This pipeline automates the end-to-end processing of survey dataâ€”from raw ingestion to statistical output and publication. It ensures reproducibility, and efficiency in producing official statistics. The pipeline is designed to be modular, supporting both internal quality assurance and external publication standards.

## Getting started

Start write your documentation by adding more markdown (.md) files to this folder (/docs) or replace the content in this file.

## Table of Contents

The Table of Contents on the right is generated automatically based on the hierarchy
of headings. Only use one H1 (`#` in Markdown) per file.

## Site navigation

For new pages to appear in the left hand navigation you need edit the `mkdocs.yml`
file in root of your repo. The navigation can also link out to other sites.

Alternatively, if there is no `nav` section in `mkdocs.yml`, a navigation section
will be created for you. However, you will not be able to use alternate titles for
pages, or include links to other sites.

Note that MkDocs uses `mkdocs.yml`, not `mkdocs.yaml`, although both appear to work.
